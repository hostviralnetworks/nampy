Network Analysis and Modeling for Python


These modules are currently under development at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute
and collaborating groups in support of multiple projects in the investigation of viral/host interactions,

especially flu-omics:
www.fluomics.org

and hint:
http://hint.org

Prereqesites:
Basic operation: scipy/numpy
ID mapping: BioServices, BioPython
More statistics: rpy2/R

Why?

Basically, I've started to develop a small tool targeted to:
- performing efficient analyses on networks and omics data
- take advantage of the many Python packages available and being developed by others 
- integrate established network analysis methods
- object oriented & flexible to facilitate inegrating new omics data types as they become available
- create a framework to inspire the development of other applications

I recommend starting with the example for now, that is stable.

You may notice similarities with other open source
resources, including the COBRApy project,
