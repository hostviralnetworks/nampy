Network Analysis and Modeling for Python


These modules are currently under development at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute
and collaborating groups in support of multiple collaborations in the investigation of viral/host interactions,

especially flu-omics:
www.fluomics.org

and hint:
http://hint.org

Prereqesites:
Basic operation: scipy/numpy
ID mapping: bioservices

Why?

Basically, I've started to develop a small tool targeted to:
- performing efficient analyses on networks and omics data
- take advantage of the many Python packages available and being developed by others 
- integrate established network analysis methods
- object oriented & flexible to facilitate inegrating new omics data types as they become available
- create a framework to inspire the development of other applications

Hopefully others in the community will find this useful.
This is a work in progress and I'll try to develop it as best as
possible as a stable tool as my research progresses.  Please contact
me if you are interested in contributing.

"NAMpy" seems shameless, albeit apt, it will probably change when I am feeling more creative.

I recommend starting with the example for now, that is stable.

You may notice similarities with the open source COBRApy project:
Ebrahim, A., Lerman, J., Palsson, B. O., & Hyduke, D. R. (2013). 
COBRApy: COnstraints-Based Reconstruction and Analysis for Python. 
BMC systems biology, 7(1), 74. doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-74

Note there is a module included to convert to COBRA models here but isn't fully tested/debugged yet.
